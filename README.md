IPF Browser
==============================

IPF Browser is a tool to browse the contents of IPFs and extract files from
them. I created it as an alternative to IPF Suite because it doesn't support
the encrypted IPF files yet and lacks little "quality of life" features I
was missing.

Features
------------------------------
- Reads any IPF files, be it iCBT1, 2, or current kTOS/iTOS ones.
- (Fast) extraction of single files, all files in one IPF, or an entire client's data.
- Optional preview for all text, image, and font files.

Limits
------------------------------
- No IPF editing.
- No 3D preview (yet).
